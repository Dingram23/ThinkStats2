ThinkStats2
===========

Text and supporting code for [Think Stats, 2nd Edition](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/index.html)


- ADDED BY Dingram23:
- The exercises in this book were provided as follows (example for chapter one): chap01ex.ipynb and .py
- The files of different type, despite the similar name, contained different exercises.
- My answers to them are saved in code\My_Answers, titled (example for chapter one): chap01ex_comp.ipynb and .py
- Note that if the .ipynb files do not open in github, pasting the url into https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ will show them just fine.
