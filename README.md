ThinkStats2
===========

Text and supporting code for [Think Stats, 2nd Edition](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/index.html)


- ADDED BY Dingram23:
- The exercises in this book were provided as follows (example for chapter one): chap01ex.ipynb and .py
- The files of different type, despite the similar name, contained different exercises.
- My answers to them are saved in \code, with a .py and .ipynb for each chapter - titled (example) 'Chap01_Exercises_Completed.py'
- Note that if the .ipynb files do not open in github, pasting the url into https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ will show them just fine.
